# Contributing

Your feedback and contributions are welcome. rubico is still young, and no where close to how great it could be. There's 23 functions; I challenge you to come up with 24. If you have a suggestion, please raise an issue, just be sure to search through the issues first in case your suggestion has been suggested already. I will see to it that all issues are properly indexed. Enhancements should tie back to the goals of the library; for example, I'm debating the addition of a [curry](https://github.com/a-synchronous/rubico/issues/18) function because it could potentially enhance the composability of functional transformations with rubico.

Pull requests should provide some basic context and link the relevant issue[s]. My intention is that progress on the library follow an issue -> pull request format. See this [pull request](https://github.com/a-synchronous/rubico/pull/12) for an example.

You can start contributing by checking out the [help wanted](https://github.com/a-synchronous/rubico/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tag.
