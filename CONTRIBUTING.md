# Contributing
Your feedback and contributions are welcome. If you have a suggestion, please raise an issue. Prior to that, make sure to search through the issues first in case your suggestion has been made already. If you decide to work on an issue, please announce on the issue thread that you will work on it.

Enhancements should follow the principles of the library:
 * asynchronous code should be simple
 * functional style should not care about async
 * functional transformations should be composable, performant, and simple to express

Pull requests should provide some basic context and link the relevant issue. My intention is that progress on the library follow an issue -> pull request format. See this [pull request](https://github.com/a-synchronous/rubico/pull/12) for an example.

If you are interested in contributing, the [help wanted](https://github.com/a-synchronous/rubico/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tag is a good place to start.
