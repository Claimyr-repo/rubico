# Contributing

Your feedback and contributions are welcome. rubico is still young, and no where close to how great it could be. There are 23 functions; I challenge you to come up with the 24th. If you have a suggestion, please raise an issue. Prior to that, make sure to search through the issues first in case your suggestion has been made already.

Enhancements should follow the principles of the library:
 * asynchronous code should be simple
 * functional style should not care about async
 * functional transformations should be composable, performant, and simple to express

For example, I am open to the addition of a [curry](https://github.com/a-synchronous/rubico/issues/18) function because it could potentially improve function composability.

Pull requests should provide some basic context and link the relevant issue. My intention is that progress on the library follow an issue -> pull request format. See this [pull request](https://github.com/a-synchronous/rubico/pull/12) for an example.

If you are interested in contributing, the [help wanted](https://github.com/a-synchronous/rubico/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tag is a good place to start.
